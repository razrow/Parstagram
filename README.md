# Project 5 - *Parstagram (Or Instagram clone)*

**Parstagram** is an android app that lets users sign in and create "posts," similar to instagram.

Submitted by: **Rowan Briggs**

Time spent: **4** hours spent in total

## User Stories

The following **required** functionality is completed:

* [x] User can sign up to create a new account using Parse authentication

* [x] User can log in and log out of his or her account

* [x] The current signed in user is persisted across app restarts 

* [x] User can take a photo, add a caption, and post it to "Instagram" 

The following **optional** functionality is completed:

* [ ] User sees app icon in home screen and styled launch screen that looks like the real Instagram page.

* [ ] Style the feed to look like the real Instagram feed.

* [ ] After the user submits a new post, show an indeterminate progress bar while the post is being uploaded to Parse

## Notes
I am okay with how this turned out. I was a bit bummed because I tried messing with the Progress Bar to get it to load after clicking to submit a post, but it just did not really work out. I was a bit confused on exactly what the expectations were for this app, but I completed the required stories and figured the rest will make sense eventually.
