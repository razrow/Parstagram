The following **required** functionality is completed:

The following **optional** functionality is completed:

## Notes
I am okay with how this turned out. I was a bit bummed because I tried messing with the Progress Bar to get it to load after clicking to submit a post, but it just did not really work out. I was a bit confused on exactly what the expectations were for this app, but I completed the required stories and figured the rest will make sense eventually.
